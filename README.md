# Solving a delivery problem.
## Premise
Suppose you need to go to a few different places to run errands. What's the shortest path that gets you to all destinations and then return home?  
In graph theory, a common way to solve this problem is treating it as a Traveling Salesman Problem (for more information on TSP check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).  
The issue is that not all graphs fulfill the prerequisites for TSP. For said graphs, one can instead lift the limitation that each destination must be visited only once, though that itself creates several more complexions.  
The project report found in this repository details solving this generalization (denoted as the <b>delivery problem<\b>) yes
