## Folder names
The number in the folder name represents the number of nodes of the graphs contained in the folder.  
There are two child directories in each folder: `input` and `output`.  
`input` contains all .dat files used in AMPL.  
`output` contains all .txt files that contain AMPL outputs.
## File names
Each file has a suffix (number between 0 and 99 inclusive, or tsp.) For inputs, it refers to the graph index.  
For outputs, it refers to either the graph index for delivery problem outputs, or the TSP problem outputs for all graphs.
